Back on the \r\nTrain, Bug, and My Left Toe made their Phish debuts, although Trey played them on his May, 1999, solo \r\ntour. Also, Bug had been played by Amfibian since they debuted the song on November 4, 1998, albeit \r\nwith slightly different lyrics. Swept Away and Steep were played for the first time since June 30, 1998 (62 shows).\r\n\r\nAdditional notes about this source:\r\nMark Nutter kindly allowed Scott to run this rig throughout the Summer tour. \r\nA 15ft digital line from Scott's PDR1000 was connected to a digital patchbay \r\nfrom which a great many tapes were recorded, including some of the previously \r\ncirculating sources. After the tour, all of the master DATs were cloned for \r\nMark Nutter. Subsequent clones from Mark Nutter's copies have also been seeded \r\nover the years. This series is the first transfer of the master dats at the head \r\nof this chain.\r\n\r\nThanks to Mark for the gear. Thanks to Scott for running it and \r\nthanks again to Scott for lending me the masters to transfer.\r\n\r\nEnjoy.\r\n-rj\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nffp:\r\nph1999-06-30d1t01.flac:5e9e6a99deed0d19233b0bafe0ff5830\r\nph1999-06-30d1t02.flac:b8780b9423056c05b24d55b8776c3385\r\nph1999-06-30d1t03.flac:0eddea4ec4bb720069ca40b2a1d6736b\r\nph1999-06-30d1t04.flac:998ccb50e2c12b10c25ad00e907c9fcb\r\nph1999-06-30d1t05.flac:933cbc7888c94114379f1b0622c6cba8\r\nph1999-06-30d1t06.flac:77255f907a5e188480617ffea698bcd0\r\nph1999-06-30d1t07.flac:aa2abbf76646b4825a6b73337ab3fd96\r\nph1999-06-30d1t08.flac:0738c524054dcd1c80b27fc08460d54b\r\nph1999-06-30d2t01.flac:832d685f7b9f4493c1e80f1045471b9d\r\nph1999-06-30d2t02.flac:65b5cdd8f6b41b9c08c9ef8722d95581\r\nph1999-06-30d2t03.flac:b4539b5d2a82f50aada2876746bc136c\r\nph1999-06-30d2t04.flac:3250daef046ecebcfafa5e2b507b2d91\r\nph1999-06-30d2t05.flac:fa5cc48d48e8f2eda75c15ce9e49e3c5\r\nph1999-06-30d2t06.flac:5e5ffba4b9667c4a05b91d03b888a130\r\nph1999-06-30d2t07.flac:71b71e04b8a0a3bde57c1552a6dd5fd4\r\nph1999-06-30d3t01.flac:f463fae3829f68fbf85729ee1ef47dc2\r\nph1999-06-30d3t02.flac:838859d1a8cd23ac9b8e610bf4b304a4\r\nph1999-06-30d3t03.flac:c907a48d102e14a00acb737b1b9fcbf7\r\nph1999-06-30d3t04.flac:b83db306a281dd6f2787e1e1ee56c6d5\r\nph1999-06-30d3t05.flac:fcf9cedf175e14fb0ea0cc62ceacafc1\r\nph1999-06-30d3t06.flac:3f584cc68173b809f2229b35dd83d2e0\r\n\r\n\r\nshntool output:\r\n length expanded size cdr WAVE problems fmt ratio filename\r\n 19:51.01 210094796 B --- -- ---xx flac 0.5020 ph1999-06-30d1t01.flac\r\n 5:53.09 62290412 B --- -- ---xx flac 0.5294 ph1999-06-30d1t02.flac\r\n 4:38.45 49145084 B --- -- ---xx flac 0.5295 ph1999-06-30d1t03.flac\r\n 4:32.65 48133724 B --- -- ---xx flac 0.4809 ph1999-06-30d1t04.flac\r\n 6:00.31 63576956 B --- -- ---xx flac 0.4789 ph1999-06-30d1t05.flac\r\n 14:50.21 157045436 B --- -- ---xx flac 0.5189 ph1999-06-30d1t06.flac\r\n 11:33.61 122388716 B --- -- ---xx flac 0.4992 ph1999-06-30d1t07.flac\r\n 5:08.12 54359468 B --- -- ---xx flac 0.5307 ph1999-06-30d1t08.flac\r\n 10:19.62 109337468 B --- -- ---xx flac 0.4827 ph1999-06-30d2t01.flac\r\n 15:06.24 159874892 B --- -- ---xx flac 0.5045 ph1999-06-30d2t02.flac\r\n 9:28.42 100294028 B --- -- ---xx flac 0.5341 ph1999-06-30d2t03.flac\r\n 8:23.51 88849196 B --- -- ---xx flac 0.5087 ph1999-06-30d2t04.flac\r\n 1:25.67 15151628 B --- -- ---xx flac 0.4108 ph1999-06-30d2t05.flac\r\n 2:21.32 24947708 B --- -- ---xx flac 0.4429 ph1999-06-30d2t06.flac\r\n 8:23.35 88811564 B --- -- ---xx flac 0.5011 ph1999-06-30d2t07.flac\r\n 9:47.67 103704428 B --- -- ---xx flac 0.5210 ph1999-06-30d3t01.flac\r\n 9:13.26 97610396 B --- -- ---xx flac 0.5038 ph1999-06-30d3t02.flac\r\n 13:57.44 147750332 B --- -- ---xx flac 0.4662 ph1999-06-30d3t03.flac\r\n 2:51.62 30310268 B --- -- ---xx flac 0.4319 ph1999-06-30d3t04.flac\r\n 3:52.32 41000108 B --- -- ---xx flac 0.4906 ph1999-06-30d3t05.flac\r\n 6:12.06 65634956 B --- -- ---xx flac 0.5191 ph1999-06-30d3t06.flac\r\n 173:52.45 1840311564 B 0.5015 (21 files)",

While \r\nsome in the crowd expected Bruce Springsteen (who was in the middle of a run of 15 sold-out \r\ndates at New Jersey's Continental Airlines Arena), Trey produced Tom Marshall. Tom appeared \r\nin the classic Born in the U.S.A. - era Springsteen outfit, complete with red bandana. He \r\nsubsequently sang the debut of Born to Run. As the song concluded Tom mocked a bunch of \r\nSpringsteen-esque arena-rock clichs, such as throwing his bandana into the crowd and jogging \r\noffstage to a handler who threw a towel around his shoulders.

I used the DPA 4011 source to replace this short segment,\r\nfor a length of approximately 20 seconds starting at 04:18.\r\n\r\nOne other thing to note about the DPA 4011 source is that the overall recording level is louder.\r\nFor the patch in Piper, I adjusted the levels on the DPA source to match the Schoeps, so the patch would be smoother.\r\nFor the splice in Harry Hood, and everything after the splice, I left the DPA source levels as orginally recorded.",

ASZ \r\nincluded Do You Feel Like We Do (Peter Frampton) teases (possibly as a nod to the play on words in \r\nthe Hampton Comes Alive title upon the band's return to the venue) and Weekapaug included a Norwegian \r\nWood tease and a Buffalo Bill tease. \r\n--------------------\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nJust a note on the source, the taper sat behind the stage on the lower level and\r\ntaped from his seat. I think he has taped from this spot before, but this is\r\nthe only tape I've heard from this spot - hopefully other sources like this will emerge! \r\n\r\nAnd maybe I'm deaf or wasn't paying attention, but I don't hear a drop out in Sand\r\nlike on the previous version of this set... \r\n\r\nThanks to Steve for providing the DATs!\r\n\r\nThanks to Jason Sobel for pointing out my error in the first set, I had my NJB3\r\nrecording at 48, when it should have been 44.1. Please destroy the old seed and\r\nreplace with this new seed.\r\n\r\nFlames, comments, corrections:\r\n\r\nTerry Watts\r\n--------------------",

Meatstick \r\n6. P.A. Here Comes the Sun$\r\n\r\n\r\nShow Notes: After Midnight debuted at this show. During the Jim opener, fans participated in \r\nmarshmallow and tortilla wars while also releasing many balloons. I Didn't Know featured Fishman \r\n(introduced as 'Soda Jerk') on vacuum. SOAM was unfinished. After the ensuing Catapult, Trey remarked \r\nthat they could only get away with playing a song like that at the largest concert in the world. The \r\nlate set, also known as \"The Show,\" began at around 11:35. Father Time was on stage, pedaling on an \r\nexercise bike that powered a large clock. The sounds of the clock's gears could be heard through the \r\nsound system. About ten minutes before midnight, Father Time collapsed from exhaustion and the clock \r\nstopped. Then, a large fan boat entered the concert field and approached the stage. Early in its \r\njourney, the fan boat exploded away and revealed the hot dog used in the 1994 New Year's stunt. While \r\nthe band rode the hot dog to the stage, an instrumental version of Meatstick began to play over the PA. \r\nThe band reached the stage and fed several meatsticks to Father Time, reviving him so that the clock could \r\ncontinue moving toward midnight. The band then took the stage and played Meatstick to begin The Show. \r\nHeavy Things was recorded live and rebroadcast as part of ABC television's New Year's Eve coverage. \r\nIn a humorous effort to confuse the home audience, Trey instructed the crowd to chant the word \r\n\"cheesecake\" in lieu of cheering at the end of the song. Trey then introduced the band for the \r\nrebroadcast and offered a message of peace and harmony for the world where he reminded people to \r\ndrive in the right lane unless passing another vehicle. Meatstick was subsequently teased as the New \r\nYear approached in the central time zone. Sand included a My Soul tease from Mike and Crosseyed \r\nincluded a DEG tease. YEM included a vocal jam based around the word \"cheesecake\" and Trey altered the \r\nlyrics to Axilla and Albuquerque to reference the word. Quadrophonic Toppling debuted, albeit with \r\ndifferent music than on The Siket Disc. Rock and Roll included an After Midnight tease. Love You \r\nincluded band introductions; Fishman introduced Page before the song and Mike and Trey afterwards, and \r\nthe band as Phish 2000 (see November 2, 1990). ASZ began with the signature Hood drum roll. After the \r\nshow closed with yet another version of Meatstick, the Beatles song Here Comes the Sun was piped \r\nthrough the crowd at sunrise. Several breakouts were played: Albuquerque (first since December 28, 1998,\r\n or 67 shows), Crosseyed and Painless (first since August 13, 1997, or 158 shows), and Love You (first \r\nsince July 5, 1997, or 178 shows).",
